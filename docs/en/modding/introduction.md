## Creating Your First Mod

Mod packages are in `zip` format without any custom suffix

### 1. Basic Structure

To standardize mod development, we define the following mod folder structure:

```
my_mod/
├── mod.toml         # Mod configuration file
├── assets/          # Asset files
│   ├── textures/    # Texture files
│   ├── sounds/      # Audio files
│   └── effects/     # Effect files
├── scripts/         # Script files
│   ├── units/       # Unit definitions
│   ├── ai/          # AI behaviors
│   └── gui/         # UI scripts
└── localization/    # Localization files
    ├── en/          # English
    └── zh/          # Chinese
```

### 2. Mod Configuration

`mod.toml` example:

```toml
id = "my_awesome_mod"
name = "my_awesome_mod"
version = "1.0.0"
author = "Your Name"
description = "this is my awesome mod"

[dependencies]
base_game = "^1.0.0"

```

### 3. Creating Units
RustPlanet's unit system uses a toml+lua structure, where each unit is a toml file containing unit properties and behaviors.

Unit properties example:

```toml
[core]
id = "heavy_tank"
name = "heavy_tank"
armor = 15
speed = 0.7
attackDamage = 40
attackRange = 7
maxHp=500
energy=100

[movement]
type = "LAND"
movementSpeed = 0.7
acceleration = 1.5
deceleration = 1.2


```
